**************************
  What's New In Pylint 1.9
**************************

:Release: 1.9
:Date: |TBA|


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* None so far

New checkers
============

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about the removed ``operator.div`` function.

* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing functions that have been
  moved from the urllib module in corresponding subpackages, such as ``urllib.request``.

  .. code-block:: python

      from urllib import urlencode

  Instead the previous code should use ``urllib.parse`` or ``six.moves`` to import a
  module in a Python 2 and 3 compatible fashion:

  .. code-block:: python

      from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlencode


* A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about invalid raise syntax:

  .. code-block:: python

      raise Exception, "value", tb


  To have this working on Python 3 as well, please use the ``six`` library:

  .. code-block:: python

      six.reraise(Exception, "value", tb)


Other Changes
=============

* `defaultdict` and subclasses of `dict` are now handled for `dict-iter-*` checks. That
  means that the following code will now emit warnings for when `iteritems` and friends
  are accessed:

  .. code-block:: python

      some_dict = defaultdict(list)
      ...
      some_dict.iterkeys()
