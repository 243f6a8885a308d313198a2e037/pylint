**************************
  What's New In Pylint 1.6
**************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |TBD|


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* None yet.

Other Changes
=============

* The HTML support was deprecated and will be eventually removed
  in Pylint 2.0.

  This feature was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being
  often neglected and having a couple of bugs. Since we now have
  the JSON reporter, this can be used as a basis for more prettier
  HTML outputs than what Pylint can currently offer.

* The ``--files-output`` option was deprecated and will be eventually
  removed in Pylint 2.0.
