:Release: |release|
:Date: |TBD|


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

Nothing major.


New checkers
============

* We added a new recommendation check, ``consider-iterating-dictionary``,
  which is emitted when a dictionary is iterated by using ``.keys()``.

  For instance, the following code would trigger this warning, since
  the dictionary's keys can be iterated without calling the method explicitly.

  .. code-block:: python

      for key in dictionary.keys():
          ...
      
      # Can be refactored to:
      for key in dictionary:
          ...


* We added a new option, ``redefining-builtins-modules``, which is used for
  controlling the modules which can redefine builtins. This can be useful,
  for instance, when wanting to use more forward-looking functions, such as
  those from ``six.moves``::

      # Oups, now pylint emits a redefined-builtin message.
      from six.moves import open

* ``trailing-newlines`` check was added, which is emitted when a file has trailing newlines.


* ``invalid-length-returned`` check was added, which is emitted when the ``__len__``
  special method returns something else than a non-negative number. For instance, this
  example is triggering it::

      class Container(object):
          def __len__(self):
              return self._items # Oups, forgot to call len() over it.



* Add a new check to the *check_docs* extension for looking for duplicate
  constructor parameters in a class constructor docstring or in a class docstring.

  The check ``multiple-constructor-doc`` is emitted when the parameter is documented
  in both places.


* We added a new extension plugin, 'pylint.extensions.mccabe', which can be used
  for warning about the complexity in the code.

  You can enable it as in::

      $ pylint module_or_project --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe


New features
============

* ``generated-members`` now support qualified names through regular expressions.

  For instance, for ignoring all the errors generated by ``numpy.core``'s attributes, we can
  now use::

      $ pylint a.py --generated-members=numpy.*


* Add the ability to ignore files based on regex matching, with the new ``--ignore-patterns`` option.

  Rather than clobber the existing ``ignore`` option, we decided to have a separate
  option for it. For instance, for ignoring all the test files, we can now use::

      $ pylint myproject --ignore-patterns=test.*?py


Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed a bug where the top name of a qualified import was detected as an unused variable.

* We don't warn about ``invalid-sequence-index`` if the indexed object has unknown
  base classes, that Pylint cannot deduce.  




Other Changes
=============

* The HTML support was deprecated and will be eventually removed
  in Pylint 2.0.

  This feature was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being
  often neglected and having a couple of bugs. Since we now have
  the JSON reporter, this can be used as a basis for more prettier
  HTML outputs than what Pylint can currently offer.

* The ``--files-output`` option was deprecated and will be eventually
  removed in Pylint 2.0.

* The ``--optimize-ast`` option was deprecated and will be eventually
  removed in Pylint 2.0.

  The option was initially added for handling pathological cases,
  such as joining too many strings using the addition operator, which
  was leading pylint to have a recursion error when trying to figure
  out what the string was. Unfortunately, we decided to ignore the
  issue, since the pathological case would have happen when the
  code was parsed by Python as well, without actually reaching the
  runtime step and as such, we will remove the option in the future.

* The ``bad-builtin`` check was moved into an extension.

  The check was complaining about used builtin functions which
  were supposed to not be used. For instance, ``map`` and ``filter``
  were falling into this category, since better alternatives can
  be used, such as list comprehensions. But the check was annoying,
  since using ``map`` or ``filter`` can have its use cases and as
  such, we decided to move it to an extension check instead.
  It can now be enabled through ``--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.bad_builtin``.

* We use the ``configparser`` backport internally, for Python 2.

  This allows having comments inside list values, in the configuration,
  such as::

      disable=no-member,
              # Don't like this check
              bad-indentation

* We now use the isort_ package internally.

  This improves the ```wrong-import-order`` check, so now
  we should have less false positives regarding the import order.


* We do not emit ``import-error`` or ``no-name-in-module`` for fallback import blocks by default.

  A fallback import block can be considered a TryExcept block, which contains imports in both
  branches, such as::

      try:
          import urllib.request as request
      except ImportError:
          import urllib2 as request

  In the case where **pylint** can not find one import from the ``except`` branch, then
  it will emit an ``import-error``, but this gets cumbersome when trying to write
  compatible code for both Python versions. As such, we don't check these blocks by default,
  but the analysis can be enforced by using the new ``--analyse-fallback-block`` flag.

* ``reimported`` is emitted when the same name is imported from different module, as in::

      from collections import deque, OrderedDict, deque
