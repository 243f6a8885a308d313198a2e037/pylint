  What's New In Pylint 1.6
**************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |TBD|


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

* None yet.

Other Changes
=============

* The HTML support was deprecated and will be eventually removed
  in Pylint 2.0.

  This feature was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being
  often neglected and having a couple of bugs. Since we now have
  the JSON reporter, this can be used as a basis for more prettier
  HTML outputs than what Pylint can currently offer.

* The ``--files-output`` option was deprecated and will be eventually
  removed in Pylint 2.0.

* The ``--optimize-ast`` option was deprecated and will be eventually
  removed in Pylint 2.0.

  The option was initially added for handling pathological cases,
  such as joining too many strings using the addition operator, which
  was leading pylint to have a recursion error when trying to figure
  out what the string was. Unfortunately, we decided to ignore the
  issue, since the pathological case would have happen when the
  code was parsed by Python as well, without actually reaching the
  runtime step and as such, we will remove the option in the future.
